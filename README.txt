An answer to speechmodule challenge from checkIO.  This is a raw solution, it needs some code clean up (some code repeats, and needs comments) but it does the job.

If you intend to use this answer, please analyse it first how it works.  This solution is a bit long, so try to trim it.  

Don't just copy and paste, you never going to learn that way and be a true pythonista!  

Actually if you copy and paste, you won't pass the challenge.
